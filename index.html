       <p>I knew  I wanted to be a musician when i saw the Rolling Stones on TV as a young boy.
       I didn't understand what they are doing, just hearing. I asked my PAPA, "papa what is that?" He told me that it's music. After sometime i tried to sing,but couldn't! when i was class two , i sang a song. That was my first song. Now i want to be the best singer of the world and i wish i'll!   </p>
